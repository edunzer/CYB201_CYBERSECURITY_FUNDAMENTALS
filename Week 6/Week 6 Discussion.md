## WEEK 6 DISCUSSION 

Part 1: Preventing and Responding To Web Attacks

We are all targeted by email attacks.  List factors that would cause you to be more or less convinced that a particular email message was authentic.  Which of the more convincing factors from your list would have been present in the example of the South Korean diplomatic secrets in Chapter 4?  What factors are indicative of spear phishing attacks that go beyond the a standard phishing attack and how would you recognize them? What steps can you take to prevent and mitigate phishing and spear phishing attacks?

- As stated in some of other discussions some of main convincing factors are: 
  - Sending Addresses, the more real these look the easier it is for someone to believe this is a authentic email. 
  - Urgency of Message, this is something that makes you actually tend to ignore some of the common signs of a spam email. 
  - Format, could be something simple like does it look professional or is there small discrepancies like incorrect image sizing. Event outdated logos from the supposed company.
  - Overall spelling, the messages body and topic are present and fit with other elements of the email.

- All of the above were factors that came into place with the South Korean example where the emails had spoofed ip addresses along with having convincing formatting to mimic the already existing professional format of other real emails. 

- The main difference between phishing and spear phishing is the personalization of the email/message. For phishing the goal much like net fishing is to send a single email across a wide range and hope that some people will fall for it despite its duplicate content to everyone. The content is typically very broad and does not include identifying information to the receiver. Spear phishing is therefore the targeting of a single person with each email. The emails are tailored to the individual person and therefore have a higher chance of success. Often there is more personal information that makes the message more legitimate looking. These could be used in identity theft were the hacker is only looking at a single person, but can also be used on a mass scale if you have the required personal information from everyone your sending too thanks to "merge fields" on emails. 

- In order to mitigate the possibility of clicking into a basic phishing email all you really have to do is think for a second about the email and why you are receiving it. Does the email have a link you need to click? Does it imply you need to urgently click on the link? Is there any content in reference to you specifically? Some of the same is true for Spear phishing but you will have to be looking closer at the sending address, the formatting, the topic and its relevance to that moment. Also some of the included information might be old and outdated and therefore suggests that its harvested data from another location. 

- The best phishing emails are often the ones that have the big 3: correct personal information, relevance to current events, and urgency. For example in the new there was public security breach of a large company that you frequently use. They send you email shortly after saying that because of this breach they would like you do update some information on there site and include a link to that "site". For most people that would be enough to fool them and its easy to understand why. This would be a planned and researched attack that was well thought out.
