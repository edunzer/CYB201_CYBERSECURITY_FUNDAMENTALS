## INTRODUCTION

Please introduce yourself to the class.  Include your name, field of study, what you'd like to learn about cybersecurity this term, and something interesting about yourself that will help us remember you.  

Hi my name is Ethan. 

I am a senior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. I am currently working at Opus agency as a Salesforce Admin. You can probably guess that I like computers based on my major but I also like working on my car, cooking, and home improvement projects.

As far as interests in cybersecurity goes I really just want to learn more about multi layer attacks on large organizations.
